"Welding printers" are metal 3d printers that build a part up by melting metal wire or powder onto the part layer by layer.
These types of printers have many benefits over DMLS, but they have some major downsides:
 - **Parts are not fully dense.** Welding is an inherently messy process, leaving inconsistent voids in the part.
 - **Grinding requirement.** Usually the additive printing must be paused periodically to grind away excess material.
 - **No small features.** Welding does not scale down well to features that are millimeters in size.


Atomwell's proprietary selective powder deposition process prints parts that are 100% dense without post-processing, requires no grinding, and supports very small features.
